1. read the first letter last name on the first folder
2. check to see if a pile with that first letter has been made:
    - if its made we will add the file to that pile
    - if not make we will create a new pile for that letter
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for every folder we have
4. Look at the second letter and the following letter of the last name and in that letter pile
    - start at the top of the pile
    - compare the last sorted name to the next folder name
        a. if the next folder name second letter is closer a than the first we will move that folder to the top and move on
        b. if its not then leave that second folder in position and move on
        c. if the letters are the same then we start left name and then sort by the first leter thans different
        repeat steps a-c until we are sorted 
5. stack all the piles in order from A-z starting with A on Top
